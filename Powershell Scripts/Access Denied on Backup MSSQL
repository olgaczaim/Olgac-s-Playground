Cannot open MSSQL Backup Directory
Look in Windows Services. Start > Administration > Services

Find the Service in the list called: SQL Server (MSSQLSERVER) look for the "Log On As" column (need to add it if it doesn't exist in the list).

This is the account you need to give permissions to the directory, right click in explorer > properties > Shares (And Security)
